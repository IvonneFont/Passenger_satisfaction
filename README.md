# Airline passenger satisfaction investigation

This was my third project in my Data Science course. The requirements were as shown below:

Description:
The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules. Select a data set and analyse it using the techniques learned in recent modules. Prepare and present a 10-minute PowerPoint presentation and a 5-minute Jupyter notebook presentation in class.

Things to consider:
1. Application of your choice
2. Dataset that is not tidy
3. Feature selection / Dimensionality reduction
4. Visualization
5. Machine learning models (at least 3)
6. Performance metric
7. Hyperparameter tuning
8. Comparison between models

In this assignment I applied KMeans clustering, HDBSCAN clustering and PCA dimensionality reduction.
